# XMCY-ODC - PHP Exercise - v21.0.5

A [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)-based installer and runtime for the [Symfony](https://symfony.com) web framework, with full [HTTP/2](https://symfony.com/doc/current/weblink.html), HTTP/3 and HTTPS support.

## Getting Started

1. If not already done, [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.10+)
2. Run `make build` to build fresh images
3. Run `make up` (the logs will not be displayed in the current shell. Use `make logs` if you want to see the container's log after it has started.)
4. Open `https://localhost` in your favorite web browser and [accept the auto-generated TLS certificate](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15076602/1352334)
5. Run `make down` to stop the Docker containers.
